# Simple API Data Extractors

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to extract and display information from APIs. It includes two small applications: one that fetches jokes and another that retrieves weather data.

## Project Structure

- `Chucknorrisjoke.py`: Python script that extracts random jokes from an API.
- `weather.py`: Python script that retrieves weather data for different cities from an API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You will need the `requests` library to run the scripts.

### Installation

If `requests` is not already installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Running the Scripts

- To run the joke API script:
  ```bash
  python joke_api.py
  ```

- To run the weather API script:
  ```bash
  python weather_api.py
  ```

## Usage

Modify the API endpoints and parameters in the scripts as needed to fetch different types of data or to use different APIs.
